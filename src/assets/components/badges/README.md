Badges  
Last Updated: November 16, 2015

##Badges
Badges are currently implemented in the navigation, and can be added to any main navigation item. It will display a counter of items, such as the amount of funds in the queue.

**Note**: This component may be expanded later for use elsewhere, but should not contain any markup changes.

```html
<span class="badge">99</span>
```

While badges are not attached to `<span>`, it's recommended that the element be `display: inline-block`.
