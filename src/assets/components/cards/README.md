Cards
Last Updated: November 17, 2015

## Cards

Content cards are styled containers that hold additional pieces of content, including grid layouts.

```html
<div class="card">
  <h1>Content</h1>
</div>
```

A utility class of `.pad` is also available for cards. Generally used on full-width `.col-xs-12` cards, this utility class will change the `padding` value from `30px` to `60px`.

```html
<div class="card pad">
  <h1>Content</h1>
</div>
```
